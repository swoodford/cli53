cli53 - Command line script to administer the Amazon Route 53 DNS service
=========================================================================


Introduction
------------
cli53 provides import and export from BIND format and simple command line management of
Route 53 domains.

Features:

- create hosted zones

- delete hosted zones

- list hosted zones

- import from BIND format

- export to BIND format

- create resource records

- delete resource records

- works with BIND format zone files we all know and love - no need to edit
  &lt;ChangeResourceRecordSetsRequest&gt; XML!

- create AWS weighted records

- create AWS Alias records to ELB

- create AWS latency-based routing records

- dynamic record creation for EC2 instances

Getting Started
---------------

Create a hosted zone::

	$ cli53 create example.com --comment 'my first zone'

Check what we've done::

	$ cli53 list

Import a BIND zone file::

	$ cli53 import example.com --file zonefile.txt

Replace with an imported zone, waiting for completion::

	$ cli53 import example.com --file zonefile.txt --replace --wait

Manually create some records::

	$ cli53 rrcreate example.com www A 192.168.0.1 --ttl 3600
	$ cli53 rrcreate example.com www A 192.168.0.2 --ttl 3600 --replace
	$ cli53 rrcreate example.com '' MX '10 192.168.0.1' '20 192.168.0.2'

Export as a BIND zone file (useful for checking)::

	$ cli53 export example.com

Create some weighted records::

	$ cli53 rrcreate example.com www A 192.168.0.1 --weight 10 --identifier server1
	$ cli53 rrcreate example.com www A 192.168.0.2 --weight 20 --identifier server2

Create an alias to ELB::

	$ cli53 rrcreate example.com www ALIAS 'ABCDEFABCDE dns-name.elb.amazonaws.com.'

Further documentation is available, e.g.::

	$ cli53 --help
	$ cli53 rrcreate --help


Installation
------------

	$ sudo pip install cli53

You can then run cli53 from your path:

	$ cli53

You need to set your Amazon credentials in the environment as AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY or configure them in ~/.boto. For more information see:
http://code.google.com/p/boto/wiki/BotoConfig

Broken CNAME exports (GoDaddy)
------------------------------
Some DNS providers export broken bind files, without the trailing '.'
on CNAME records. This is a requirement for absolute records
(i.e. ones outside of the qualifying domain).

If you see CNAME records being imported to route53 with an extra
mydomain.com on the end (e.g. ghs.google.com.mydomain.com), then you
need to fix your zone file before importing:

        $ perl -pe 's/(CNAME\s+[-a-zA-Z0-9.-_]+)(?!.)$/$1./i' broken.txt > fixed.txt

Dynamic records for EC2 instances
---------------------------------
This functionality allows you to give your EC2 instances memorable DNS names
under your domain. The name will be taken from the 'Name' tag on the instance,
if present, and a CNAME record created pointing to the instance's public DNS
name (ec2-...).

In the instance Name tag, you can either use a partial host name 'app01.prd' or
'app01.prd.mydomain.com' - either creates the correct record.

The CNAME will resolve to the external IP address outside EC2 and to the
internal IP address from another instance inside EC2.

Another feature supported is whilst an instance is stopped, if you specify the
parameter '--off fallback.mydomain.com' you can have the dns name fallback to
another host. As an example, a holding page could be served up from this
indicating the system is off currently.

You can use the '--match' parameter (regular expression) to select a subset of
the instances in the account to apply to.

Generally you'll configure cli53 to run regularly from your crontab like so::

    */5 * * * cli53 instances example.com

This runs every 5 minutes to ensure the records are up to date. When there no
changes, this will purely consist of a call to list the domain and the describe
instances API.

If the account the EC2 instances are in differs from the account the route53
domain is managed under, you can configure the EC2 credentials in a separate
file and pass the parameter '--credentials aws.cfg' in. The credentials file is
of the format::

    [profile prd]
    aws_access_key_id=...
    aws_secret_access_key=...
    region=eu-west-1

    [profile qa]
    aws_access_key_id=...
    aws_secret_access_key=...
    region=eu-west-1

As illustrated above, this also allows you to discover instances from multiple
accounts - for example if you split prd and qa. cli53 will scan all '[profile
...]' sections.

Private/public zones
--------------------
To manage zones that have both a private and a public zone, you must specify the
zone ID instead the domain name, which is ambiguous. This is the 13 character ID
after '/hostedzone/' you can see in the output to 'cli53 list'. eg::

    $ cli53 rrcreate ZZZZZZZZZZZZZ name A 127.0.0.1


Caveats
-------
As Amazon limits operations to a maximum of 100 changes, if you
perform a large operation that changes over 100 resource records it
will be split. An operation that involves deletes, followed by updates
such as an import with --replace will very briefly leave the domain
inconsistent. You have been warned!
